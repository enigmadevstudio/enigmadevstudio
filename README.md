## About Us

**Enigma Development Studio** is an independent, passionate, and ever-growing tech team that started its journey back in **2016**.

It all began in high school, when **Daniel Salehi** and **Reza Mahdipour** decided to turn their curiosity into action — and build a team that breathes technology.

Since then, we’ve been learning, growing, and pushing boundaries across various tech domains.
